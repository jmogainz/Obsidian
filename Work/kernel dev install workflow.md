# Kernel Dev Install Workflow

### Timeshift
- not recommended, this is for host systems, and you need live usb

### Virsh snapshot
- optimal if you think you are going to break something...but you can use grub boot menu to boot into different kernel image

### Grub grub-reboot single reboot attempt
- only for one reboot, it will attempt to boot into the kernel you specify
