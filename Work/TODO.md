	- [ ] Composite
		- [x] Dict
		- [ ] Tuple
		- [ ] Sequence
- [x] Test onnx with ppo
- [ ] Test onnx with box space ppo

- [x] Write tests for discrete
- [x] Write tests for box
- [x] Write tests for Dict
- [x] Set shape for all spaces
- [x] Look into onnx runtime building as submodule
	- [ ] Do we want to statically link specific staic onnxruntime libs to our project? Or do we want to dynamically link the entire onnxruntime shared lib to our project?
- [x] Look into debugging into pybind code linux vsc
	- [x] Debug build in setup.py tell daniel that we need this option for our setup.py !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- [x] Look into debugging into pybind code windows vsc
- [x] Look into debugging into pybind code clion
- [x] Add option to use vector with box input
- [x] Check on reording of setup file to use venv1
- [x] Clean up disk
- [x] Check ram and cpu usage
- [x] Push up changes to box check high and low

- [ ] Potentially add with report time to grammar
	- [ ] Potentially use vehicleId, platformName, disId
- [ ] cursor jump setting
- [x] refactor into smaller functions
- [x] create callbacks at observationhandler initialization
- [x] Add start param to multidiscrete
- [ ] consider manager history count
- [x] Figure out compiler warning bombs (xtensor, pybind11, boost)
- [ ] Remove long long int....change uot for uint16
- [ ] Tell daniel about  problem with vscode debugger?
	- [ ] vscode debugger appears to be ignoring the runpath completely on all my wrapper modules (so finding incorrect libstdc++ so)
- [x] Add dynamic loading of IObservationHandlers
- [ ] Add dynamic loading for handlers and thus extractors
- [x] REFACTOR 
	- [x] Validate sensors fuction can split up?
- [ ] Verify working on linux service allocator
- [x] Check with potentially using better naming to differentiate between configuration and simulation
- [ ] Check with potentially not making sensordataobserver inherited from platform data observer
- [ ] Make instruction an optional field in space params
- [x] Change namespace of new library for observations with grammar
- [x] Track repo reading is threadsafe (locks on all read functions as well as modification functions)
- [x] Need locks on my maps
- [x] Make sure sam sorted the track_ids based on numeric
- [ ] Take off I on factory for interface factories
- [x] Could potentially make factory cpp implemented
- [ ] Think about each layer of observation forming and making the sure the repos are not updated during....
- [ ] Consider storing snapshot of history up front when get observation sample so there is duplicate calls or changing results to getHIstory for platforms and sensors
- [ ] Move all factories to cpp
- [ ] Reduce header size as much as possible
- [ ] Custom exception handling
- [x] Add grammar instructions for all handling
