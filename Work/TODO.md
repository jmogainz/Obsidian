- [x] GRAMMAR update for no sampling
- [x] Change track1 to updated twice no dropped
- [ ] Move extractors into their own library? At some point?
- [ ] Refactor extractor context so that it will be inheritance based and then the grammar can create just a shared struct that has everything you would ever need in it?
	- [ ] Then the struct params would be conditionally selected to build the necessary abstract class implementation?
- [x] MAKE SLIDESHOW!!!!!
- [x] 146 on P3L
