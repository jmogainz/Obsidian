- logical progression of the concept of extensibility
- how does the hypervisor technically speaking actually allow a guest os to think its on a regular bare metal os? How does the guest os execute instructions on the cpu but yet it does not bc the hypervisor intercepts it?
	- trap? intercepted?
- memory sharing guest vs non-guest? hashing? vmware? pure share, working-set, dynamic idle-adjusted shares approach, reclaim most idel memory
- data transer full vs para
	- xen does some complex stuff with request cons-prod, response cons-prod (io rings?)
-  resource recording
- vmware vs xen, cpu vs memory processes
