Scale Models
Purpose: Produce Data
Rigorous and systematic evaluation of the factors that influence a design
Relevant criteria, metrics, & threshold
Comparison of various possible approaches
Explore Spaces - zoning regulations, traffic patterns, etc.

Compare different versions factors:
- Performance
- Memory footprint
- Time to construct

#### Evaluate Design in a Systematic Way

1. Context 
	- Background
	- Motivation
	- Necessary Vocabulary
2. Research Questions
	- Examines the tradeoffs of non-functional req.
	- Formulated in neutral-fasion
3. Subject
	- Compares multiple subjects
	- Each subject should be defined
4. Experimental Conditions
	- Making measurements and evaluating results
	- Describes the environment which the study will take place
5. Variables
	- Independent and dependent variables
		- Name, units of measure
		- How the research questions address them
		- Summary table with three columns
			- Q: independent and dependent
	- Appropriate metrics specified
6. Method
	- Number of trials
	- Measurement devices and tools
	- Randomization technique
	- Significant digits
	- Explicit statement of which subjects will be run and arguments used
	- Statistical techniques
7. Results
	- Data collected
	- Statistical analysis
8. Discussion
	- Interpret data
	- Discuss implications
9. Conclusions
	- Explicit answers to each of the research questions
