Paul repeats his common message to rejoice in the Lord!
	He wants to further emphasize this as the constant mindset a believer should have

Put no confidence in the flesh and stay away from the legalism found in the Judaizers, who believed it was essential to follow all Old Testament laws to receive salvation.

We ARE the circumcision, serving God BY HIS SPIRIT, boasting in Jesus Christ, and who put NO confidence in the flesh. 

What is confidence in the flesh?
	Crediting salvation, purpose, and joy to your works and what you can achieve.

Paul says he has the more reason than anyone to put confidence in the flesh
	Speaks of all his achievements
	But - whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of christ
	Paul says for the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ, he has lost all things

He has the kind of righteousness that comes from God on the BASIS OF FAITH.

The ultimate goal is to know christ, be like christ, and to be all christ has in mind for you. What am I willing to give up to reach this end? What distractions I am willing to deny. 

Phil 13-14:
Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. 

All of us should take such a view of things, and if on some point, we think differently, that too God will make clear to us. Only let us live up to what we have already attained. Keep your eyes those who live as we do. For, as I have told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. BUT OUR CITIZENSHIP IS IN HEAVEN.
