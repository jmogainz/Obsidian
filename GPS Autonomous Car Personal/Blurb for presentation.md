One of our current competitors is known as a PackBot 510. Developed by teledyne technologies, this is a man-transportable robot that performs bomb disposal, surveillance, and reconnaissance. It is controlled by a hand-held remote device and is deployed in active duty across the world. They have the ability to climb stairs and navigate through narrow passageways, making them efficient in cities and civilian heavy zones. However, they are expensive and require a trained professional to be controlling it all times.  

Drones are also currently used as an attempt to decrease the number of bomb casualties. They perfomr fly overs and attempt to detect locations of bomb threats by using various types of sensors, but they do not aid in the physical removal or handling of the bomb

Minesweeper approaches the problem differently than both of these competitors as it's aim is to be cheap and expendable, deployed in civilian-free zones, anyone on an EOD team will be able to control it with limited training, and under time sensitive scenarios, it will be the quickest option for bomb disposal. 
	

EOD teams are also currently using armored manned vehicles such as the husky, buffalo, and cougar to remove/dispose, and detect bomb threats.
	These bring risk to human operators, and have a high cost associated with them as well, monetarily and time spent on maitnenance.
