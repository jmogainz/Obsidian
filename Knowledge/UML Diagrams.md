## Structural 
#### Class
- Classes
#### Object
- Instances and values
#### Component
- Static implementation view of how components fit together
- Code entities, relationships (uses services of another, uses interface, is interface, etc.)
#### Deployment
- Instances on what processing nodes
#### Packages
- Namespace scoping, dependency arrows
#### Profiles
- Properties of Diagram, UML Meta-model extension
#### Composite
- Internal structure AND possible interactions

## Behavorial

UML does not include OMT data flow diagram
#### Use Case
- Lay out story of how a user may use the system
- Stick figures = external actors
- Ovals = use cases
- Lines without annotations indicate participation
- Extends and uses (stereotype support factoring)
 ##### Tabular
- Actor, action, object
#### Context
- High level what happens
#### Sequence
- Time goes down
#### Communication
- Looks like class model
- Lines are comms
- 
#### Activity
- Variant of state machine

#### Interaction Overview
- Kind of activity diagram where nodes correspond to lower level diagrams (sequence, comms, timing)
#### Timing
- Timing like circuit timing
#### State Diagrams
- Most powerful and most complex, also called state charts
