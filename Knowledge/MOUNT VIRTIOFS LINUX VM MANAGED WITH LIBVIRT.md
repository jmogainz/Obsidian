In a **libvirt** `<filesystem>` element configured for **VirtioFS**, the **`<target dir="..." />`** attribute is effectively used as the **tag name** for mounting inside the guest, **not** a literal filesystem path in the guest. This often confuses people because it looks like a path, but it really behaves like a label or “mount tag.”

Below is what your snippet means and how to mount it properly in the guest:

```xml
<filesystem type="mount" accessmode="passthrough">
  <driver type="virtiofs"/>
  <binary path="/usr/lib/virtiofsd"/>
  <source dir="/home/jmoore2/i2dev"/>
  <target dir="/mnt/i2dev/"/>
  <alias name="fs0"/>
  <address type="pci" domain="0x0000" bus="0x07" slot="0x00" function="0x0"/>
</filesystem>
```

## 1. How `<filesystem>` Works for VirtioFS

1. **`<source dir="/home/jmoore2/i2dev"/>`**  
   - Points to the **host** directory that `virtiofsd` will share.

2. **`<target dir="/mnt/i2dev/"/>`**  
   - This is the **“tag name”** recognized in the **guest**. Despite looking like a path, it’s just a string label.  
   - In other words, from inside the guest, you’d mount **“/mnt/i2dev/”** as the “device” (or “tag”) with `-t virtiofs`.  
   - Commonly, people use a short label like `myshare` or `shared_data` to avoid confusion, e.g. `<target dir="myshare"/>`.

3. **`<driver type="virtiofs"/>`**  
   - Tells libvirt to use **VirtioFS** rather than 9p or other filesystem passthrough.

4. **`<binary path="/usr/lib/virtiofsd"/>`**  
   - Points to the **virtiofsd** binary that handles the actual sharing on the host side.

## 2. Mounting Inside the Guest

After starting the VM, log into the guest:

1. **Create a mount point** (where you want the shared files to appear):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/hostshare
   ```
   
2. **Mount using the `<target dir>` value**  
   In your snippet, `<target dir="/mnt/i2dev/"/>` is the **tag name**—*not* a real host path. So in the guest:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t virtiofs "/mnt/i2dev/" /mnt/hostshare
   ```
   Note the quotes around `"/mnt/i2dev/"` just in case of trailing slashes or special characters.

3. **Check the contents**:
   ```bash
   ls /mnt/hostshare
   ```
   You should see the files from **`/home/jmoore2/i2dev`** on the host.

## 3. Common Pitfall: Misunderstanding `<target dir="...">`

- When you see `<target dir="someString"/>`, that **someString** acts as the “virtiofs tag.”  
- It is not automatically a real directory path inside the guest.  
- If you prefer a simpler approach, you could use `<target dir="i2dev"/>` (without slashes), then inside the guest:
  ```bash
  sudo mount -t virtiofs i2dev /mnt/hostshare
  ```
- This often avoids confusion, because people expect “/mnt/i2dev/” to be a literal path in the guest.

---

## 4. If the Mount Command Fails

1. **Check the exact error** the guest provides (`dmesg`, `journalctl -xe`).  
2. **Ensure** the `virtiofs` kernel module is loaded in the guest:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep virtiofs
   sudo modprobe virtiofs
   ```
3. **Verify** the host’s directory permissions and SELinux settings. For instance:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R qemu:qemu /home/jmoore2/i2dev
   sudo chmod -R 755 /home/jmoore2/i2dev
   sudo setsebool -P virt_use_fusefs=1
   ```
4. **Check** libvirt logs on the host:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u libvirtd
   ```

## 5. Example: A More Typical `<filesystem>` Config

If you prefer a short label as the tag:

```xml
<filesystem type="mount" accessmode="passthrough">
  <driver type="virtiofs"/>
  <binary path="/usr/lib/virtiofsd"/>
  <source dir="/home/jmoore2/i2dev"/>
  <target dir="i2dev"/>
</filesystem>
```

Then inside the guest:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/hostshare
sudo mount -t virtiofs i2dev /mnt/hostshare
```

---

### **Summary**

- In **VirtioFS** via libvirt, the `<target dir="..."/>` is a **string tag** used to mount in the guest, *not* an actual directory path on the guest.  
- You’ll mount that tag with `mount -t virtiofs <tag> <guestMountPoint>`.  
- If you keep the `/mnt/...` style in your `<target dir=...>`, you’ll need to quote or escape it properly and remember it’s just a tag, *not* an automatic mount path.
