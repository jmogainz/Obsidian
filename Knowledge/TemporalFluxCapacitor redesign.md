- DOLH move to temporalflux completely [GOOD]
- All writer construction, use, and destruction should be managed by temporal flux capacitor [?]
	-  Action handler writer/reader [GOOD]
	- Clairvoyant track service writer [maybe]
-  Who is responsible for calling shutdown? [?]
	- Environment is. Temporal flux capacitor shutdown does not "have" to do anything. The shutdown behavior could happen entirely in the environment, but since the temporal flux capacitor is like the time synchronization engine for the environment, I thought for the sake of cohesion, the environment would call the temporal flux capacitors shutdown which would just raise a barrier to finally allow the environments step thread to exit. This logic could easily be moved and the shutdown function for the temporal flux capacitor class itself be deleted.
- sendSensorLimitsRequestMessage location [?]
	- We may not need this for one
	- For two, if we do want this ability, I think it should belong to the repository that manages sensor limits data
- All readers and writers [?]
	- Why do these need to belong to the service at all....
	- If they do need to belong to the service, we can request the readers out of the temporal flux capacitor to give to the appropriate objects in environment
- Singletons are managed by TFC [GOOD]
- sensor limits barrier does not seem necessary if wanting to cohesively design our classes and give the resonsibiliity of all sensor limit storage business logic to the sensorlimitrepository
