Achieving 100% certainty in verifying a property manager is challenging but possible with a combination of specific documents and verifiable information. Here’s the **bare minimum** document and information set that provides the highest level of confidence:

## PM Verification

### 1. **Property Management Agreement or Authorization Letter**
   - **Document**: A legally binding property management agreement or letter of authority from the property owner.
   - **Verification Purpose**: This document is the clearest proof that the individual has the legal authority to manage the specified property.
   - **Requirements**: The document should:
      - Include the property address.
      - Clearly name the individual or their company as the authorized manager.
      - Be signed by the property owner or legal representative.

### 2. **Government-Issued ID**
   - **Document**: A valid government-issued ID (e.g., driver’s license, passport).
   - **Verification Purpose**: Confirms the identity of the person applying as a property manager.
   - **Requirements**: The name on the ID should match the name on the property management agreement or authorization letter.

### 3. **Proof of Business Registration or Employment**
   - **Document**: Business license, certificate of incorporation, or a letter of employment if the property manager works for a property management company.
   - **Verification Purpose**: Confirms that the property manager is affiliated with a legitimate, registered business, especially useful for corporate-managed properties.
   - **Requirements**: The business name on this document should match the name in the property management agreement. If the manager is employed by a company (rather than self-employed), an employment verification letter on company letterhead suffices.

### 4. **Utility Bill or Tax Record for the Property (Optional but Highly Effective)**
   - **Document**: Recent utility bill or property tax record showing the property address.
   - **Verification Purpose**: Confirms the property address and that the person or business involved has a financial or legal tie to it.
   - **Requirements**: The bill or tax record should be recent (within the last 3–6 months) and show the property address clearly.

### Verification Process for 100% Certainty
To achieve near 100% verification confidence:
   1. **Match Identity to Authority**: Cross-check the government-issued ID with the name on the property management agreement or authorization letter to confirm the individual’s authority.
   2. **Verify Business Legitimacy**: Check the business registration or employment letter to ensure the property manager is professionally affiliated with the property management role.
   3. **Confirm Property Details**: Optionally, verify property ownership via a utility bill or tax record, which strengthens confidence that the manager has a legal or operational connection to the property.

### Minimal Set in Summary
The absolute minimum to achieve full verification would be:
   - **Property Management Agreement or Authorization Letter**
   - **Government-Issued ID**
   - **Proof of Business Registration or Employment**

These documents together provide high assurance of both the person’s identity and their legitimate authority to act as the property manager for the specified property. If you want extra security, including a utility bill or tax record tied to the property will further confirm the validity of the connection.

We would do the above^ +- one, and add a phone call for verification and basically tell them your application is being reviewed, you can expect a response with 24 hours. You may receive a phone call if additional information is needed.

We do not want to be manually have to entering information into our systems. That is the bane of progress, and I think we could get a nice clean personalized experience through this method.
## Gated properties
- what do we do with the code?
	- screw the code. open the door, unlock the trash compactor
	- otherwise, we not coming to you
- this is actually the least of the propreties, and we can target these last, and even make them want us so they will be willing to accomodate us. 
- if they make it hard and force us to follow security, then we require at a minimum a keypad on gate/trash compactor/carts

## PM information onboarding
- all unit numbers/names
- buildings, addresses of each (if applicable)
- click on map location of trash compactors, dumpsters, and trash bins
- tenant workers will know where stuff is, otherwise first job is just going to be learning experience, most workers repeat the same jobs
	- improvement room in the future for more explicit instructions
- select whether they want optin/out abilities for the tenants

## gig worker job instructions
- no gate codes
- trash stuff locations
- building address
- current location displayed, trash stuff locations displayed
- units that need trash taken out
	- potentially could become an issue...our workers may not have time, ability, or desire to be referring back to their phone at this high of a frequency during their job. They may just start grabbing all trash they see...which could promote free loaders. Gig worker job completiion verification could potentially deter the gig worker from during this however, as they could think they would be reprimanded for this. As the before and after and *magic* ai could find out they cheated.
	- chandler thought of: colored bag ties, or door tags

## Tenants verification

- when the pm submits onboarding information, we generate unique ids for every single unit number and store them mapped, the unit # to unique id table is then returned to the pm for distribution among their tenants.
- the accounts for each unilt number are automatically popuated and setup, similar to how are work accounts are setup for us by hr. Except, this leaves it being completely anonymous which is what we want. We want to see the tenants as statistics, not people. (famous quote there. Write that down)
- tenants can then go in and sign into their unit account, and leave reviews/ opt out if they decide to, or opt back in, each of these events will notify property manager. Opt in and opt out will be month by month basis (perhaps through lease basis or 6 month basis). Cant just spam it over and over again. We will batch all opt ins and opt outs and keep the pm ui updated with this information on a monthly basis or perhaps cycle basis.
- if tenants opt out, but are still charged next month, this sounds like just a necessary evil that could occur. They will most likely contact us, and then we will contanct pm to ask why they didnt decrease that tenants monthly rent accordilngly, and they will need to refund this. I would imagin this would be a niche thing that would not happen often if I have to guess.
