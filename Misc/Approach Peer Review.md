To give a quick global review before I go more in depth, I found your Approach draft to be well written with proper organization and layout. I also appreciated how much information you guys were able to write in such a short time, and the writing was professional using the proper tense the majority of the time. I noticed that your team included many visual diagrams (even when it was not necessay), and I liked this because it helped me get a much stronger grasp of the project architecture. There were, however, a few areas that were specifically lacking (as drafts always do), such as the tables, references, paragraph structure, grammar, and spacing. Many paragraphs are indented at the beginning, when they should not be. There is also too much white space in between text bodies, titles, and tables at certain places. Tables must contain a requirements section as the first row stating the minimum in each category needed.  You mention that the chosen products meet certain requirements but I do not see them explicitly mentioned anywhere. I recommend looking at past teams approach documents for reference. Additionally, in your references section, each citation must be flush to the left margin (no indentions whatsoever). 

Starting with your top-level technical diagram, I liked the color-coded connections, neatness, and nested block design, however, I think you should consider adding some images (possibly clipart) for better visual clarification. The diagram image is also not centered in the document, and there should be slightly more spacing between the text and the diagram (top and bottom). 

For the hardware section, 2.1, I did not find anything to nit-pick. Other than adding a requirements description for each part, I thought you explained the design well and your reasoning for choosing what you did over other alternatives. I especially liked the section on vent structure and the sketch so that viewers could visualize your product from a high level. 

For the software section, 2.2, I found it to be very thorough and covering all the coding needed for the product to work properly. The only critique I have is the IDE section. I do not believe this is necessary to include in your approach draft. An IDE is a developer specific preference that is not important for the end user to know. You also mention needing libraries that only certain IDE's can give you. Code libraries are availabe on the internet and do not come from any one specific dev environment. 
I thought your firmware section was strong, and the state machine was well thought out and structured. 

Other than these small structural things, I thought you guys did a great job with your first draft. Keep on the hard work!
